# Ravioli

A tool for calculating simple, useful complexity metrics for C.

This tool is designed to work especially on embedded software written for compilers with non-standard extensions.
It works without a compiler or any preprocessing required.

## To do

- Add global variable counting.
- Add better error handling. If the parser has an error, make it easy to find the code that broke it.
- Try it on some other code.
- Run it on a single file or on a folder?
- Make the output cleaner.
